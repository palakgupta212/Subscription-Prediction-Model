# Subscription-Prediction-Model
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a service based on various demographic and behavioral features. The model is designed to help businesses optimize marketing strategies by identifying potential subscribers.

-> Process Overview
Data Collection & Cleaning – Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized numeric data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized customer behavior trends and correlations.

Model Development – Implemented classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) with hyperparameter tuning.

Evaluation – Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for performance assessment.

-> Key Features
Customer demographics (age, job, marital status, etc.)

Account information (balance, loan status, etc.)

Campaign interaction metrics (contact duration, number of calls, etc.)

Historical interaction outcomes

-> Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Git & GitHub
